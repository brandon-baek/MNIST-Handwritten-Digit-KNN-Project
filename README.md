# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-KNN-Project

**The full project can be viewed in the "MNIST_Handwritten_Digit_KNN_Project.ipynb" file**

Today, MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset trained models utilize machine learning. Although machine learning is a large portion of Artificial Intelligence, it is important to acknowledge that Artificial Intelligence is far more than just Machine Learning. Studies focused on Machine Learning will expand upon Machine Learning, but will not expand much onto Artifical Intelligence in a general-sense.

For these reasons, it is important to acknowledge, understand, and employ the vast techniques within the field of Artificial Intelligence.

This project makes use of a non-machine-learning based algorithm, the K-Nearest Neighbors model, to predict handwritten digits.
